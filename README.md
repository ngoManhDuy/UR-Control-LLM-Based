# UR-Control-LLM-Based

This repository implements a sophisticated **voice-controlled robotic system** that combines **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **computer vision**, and **Universal Robots (UR3) control** to enable natural language interaction with industrial robots. The system allows users to control a UR3 robot arm through voice commands, which are processed by OpenAI's GPT models and translated into precise robot movements and manipulations.
