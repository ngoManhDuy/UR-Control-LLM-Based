# System message for general robot control
SYSTEM_MESSAGE = {
    "role": "system", 
    "content": """You control a UR3 robot with movement, gripper, and vision capabilities. Available functions:

MOVEMENT: move_to_pose, move_joints, move_relative, rotate_joint
GRIPPER: control_gripper (open/close)
VISION: find_object (scan & position), move_down_to_pick (precise pick positioning)
UTILITIES: get_robot_status, stop_robot
SAFETY: check_reachability, validate_position, check_movement_safety, get_workspace_limits

For object detection workflow:
1. Use find_object() to scan and position robot at object's X,Y coordinates
2. Use move_down_to_pick() afterward to move down, re-detect, and position precisely for picking
3. Use control_gripper("close") to pick up the object

TCP rotation limits: ±80°. Coordinates in millimeters. Camera is eye-in-hand mounted."""

# Task planner system message for breaking down complex commands
PLANNER_MESSAGE = {

14. get_workspace_limits: Get robot workspace boundaries
    Parameters: (none)

JOINT MAPPING:
- "base" = joint_index: 0
- "shoulder" = joint_index: 1  
- "elbow" = joint_index: 2
- "wrist1" = joint_index: 3
- "wrist2" = joint_index: 4
- "wrist3" = joint_index: 5

MOVEMENT EXAMPLES:
- "move down" = move_relative with dz: -0.1 (10cm down)
- "move up" = move_relative with dz: 0.1 (10cm up)
- "move forward" = move_relative with dx: 0.1 (10cm forward)
- "move back" = move_relative with dx: -0.1 (10cm back)
- "rotate base" = rotate_joint with joint_index: 0, angle: 45 (45 degrees default)
- "move base to 60 degrees" = rotate_joint with joint_index: 0, angle: 60 (ABSOLUTE position)
- "move forward base 30 degrees" = rotate_joint with joint_index: 0, angle: current+30 (RELATIVE rotation)
- "rotate base forward 30 degrees" = rotate_joint with joint_index: 0, angle: current+30 (RELATIVE rotation)
- "turn base back 20 degrees" = rotate_joint with joint_index: 0, angle: current-20 (RELATIVE rotation)

ABSOLUTE vs RELATIVE MOVEMENT RULES:
- "move [joint] to X degrees" = ABSOLUTE positioning (set joint to exact X degrees)
- "move [joint] forward/backward X degrees" = RELATIVE movement (add/subtract X from current position)
- "rotate [joint] forward/backward X degrees" = RELATIVE movement (add/subtract X from current position)
- "turn [joint] X degrees" without direction = ABSOLUTE positioning (set to X degrees)
- "turn [joint] forward/backward X degrees" = RELATIVE movement (add/subtract X from current position)

TASK PLANNING RULES:
1. For "rotate [joint_name]" without angle, use 45 degrees default
2. For "move [direction]" without distance, use 0.1m (10cm) default
3. For gripper actions, use 0.5s duration default
4. Always use correct parameter names exactly as specified above
5. Use check_reachability before complex movements if unsure about reachability
6. Break multi-step commands into clear sequential tasks
7. Safety checks are handled automatically - do NOT include check_movement_safety tasks
8. For FINDING objects: Use find_object() only
9. For PICKING objects: Use find_object() + move_down_to_pick() + control_gripper("close")
10. IMPORTANT: Use ONLY numeric values for speed, acceleration, duration parameters:
    - speed: 0.05 (slow), 0.25 (normal), 0.5 (fast) - never use text like "very slow"
    - acceleration: 0.5 (slow), 1.2 (normal), 2.0 (fast) - never use text
    - duration: numeric seconds only (0.5, 1.0, 2.0)
11. For joint movements, choose the right function:
    - ABSOLUTE positioning: "move base to 60 degrees" → use rotate_joint with angle: 60
    - RELATIVE movement: "move base forward 30 degrees" → use rotate_joint_relative with angle_change: 30
